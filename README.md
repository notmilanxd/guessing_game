# guessing_game

## What is that?
So there is this tutorial about a [Guessing game](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html) in the book called [**"The Rust Programming Language"**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and since I've followed it and made this little program through my Journey, I thought it would be a good idea to publish it as my own (Spoiler: It wasn't)

## How to build and open it (Windows, Linux, MacOS)
*Disclaimer: I've written this tutorial with Bing AI (shoutout to him/her/them??) because I was lazy to actually think about something*

### Prerequisites

To build and run this project, you will need the following:

**Rust:** You can install Rust using rustup, the official Rust toolchain installer. Follow the instructions on the rustup website to download and install Rust for your platform. You can also check the installation chapter of the Rust book for more details.
**Cargo:** Cargo comes installed with Rust if you use rustup. You can check if you have Cargo by running cargo --version in your terminal. If you see a version number, you have it! If you see an error, such as command not found, look at the documentation for your method of installation to determine how to install Cargo separately.
**Git:** You will need Git to clone this repository from Github. You can download and install Git from the official website.

### Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

- Clone this repository to your local machine by running git clone https://github.com/your-username/rust-cargo-project-tutorial.git in your terminal.
- Navigate to the project directory by running cd guessing_game.
- Build the project by running cargo build. This will download and compile the dependencies and create an executable file in the target/debug directory.
- Run the project by running cargo run or navigate to the executable on Linux and MacOS with ```./target/debug/guessing_game``` OR on Windows with ```.\target\debug\guessing_game.exe```
